    <p>Hutong opened on 26th June 2013 on Level 33 of The Shard, serving contemporary Northern Chinese cuisine.

        Hutong takes its inspiration from the dishes served in the imperial palaces of old Peking. Based on the Lu school cuisine of Shandong Province, renowned for its seafood and vinegars, and with influences from Sichuan Province, famous for its fiery spices and peppers, the menu at Hutong artfully captures the subtlety and surprises of Northern Chinese cooking. </p>

    <p>The restaurant is named after Beijing’s ancient hutongs – the now fast-disappearing narrow lanes which criss-crossed the city revealing its old family houses, their grand courtyards and life within. Signature dishes include Red Lantern soft-shell crab and Crispy de-boned lamb ribs as well as Roasted Peking duck, considered by many to be the best in London. Hutong’s beautiful Shanghai Bar is the perfect place for cocktails before or after dinner.</p>
