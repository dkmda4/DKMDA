<!-- There are different ways to add CSS in your markup(html): -->
<!-- inline - CSS is added to the elements directly using the style attribute -->
<!-- internal - CSS is within the html file, using the style tag -->
<!-- external - both html and CSS are in separated file. the css should be saved as (.css) extension. after that we are linking the css file to the html one. -->
<!-- inline has prority over the internal and external. and betweem internal and external the last one used has prority. -->
